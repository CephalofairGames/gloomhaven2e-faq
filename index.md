## <a name="page_0" class="page-number">0.0</a> Introduction

This is the official FAQ for Gloomhaven Second Edition. It will be continuously updated as more questions are added and existing answers are clarified. I may end up changing some headings, adding subheadings, moving questions to more appropriate areas, etc. Please use your in-browser Find function to locate answers to specific questions. 

![divider](/assets/images/divider2.png)

### 0.1 Spoilers

I follow official spoiler rules in this FAQ. I will spoiler-tag all locked content, and refer to locked game contents by their locked class nickname, envelope symbol, scenario number, or item number. Note that all cards for starter classes (including higher level cards), scenarios 0-1, Personal Quests 01-10, starting items, and abilities/statistics for common monsters are not spoilers, and will not be treated as such. Please note that your in-browser Find function can also find words behind spoiler tags on this page.

![divider](/assets/images/divider2.png)

### 0.2 About Me

I am Bill (or dwarf74 in most places). I also maintain the Frosthaven FAQ, and am currently a moderator of Reddit’s /r/Gloomhaven. I am altogether too active in Gloomhaven fan communities, and I am kind of obsessive about writing guides and making lists for games I love, so Cephalofair decided to bring me on to maintain this FAQ. I'd like to give special thanks to general_cgo, gripeaway, themris, and Nikki Valens for their help.

![divider](/assets/images/divider2.png)

### 0.3 How to Ask Questions, and Helpful Links

Most of these questions were asked by the community. If you have a question that you can't find the answer to, I recommend starting there. Frosthaven has an active, knowledgable, and passionate group of fans who will be happy to help you out. While none of these communities are directly affiliated with Cephalofair, I am active on all three and will be notified when something needs added. Any of the three can work; use whichever is most appealing to you.

- [/r/Gloomhaven](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gloomhaven/) - The Gloomhaven Subreddit is for Gloomhaven, Frosthaven, and Jaws of the Lion. Spoilers are strictly moderated. There is a pinned "Small Questions" thread, or you can start your own for bigger questions.
- [BoardGameGeek Frosthaven Forums](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/295770/frosthaven/forums/0) - Another active forum, and the previous home of this FAQ. Spoiler tags are appreciated, but are completely unmoderated.
- [Frosthaven Outpost Discord Server](http://discord.gg/hPrwrm2) - The Frosthaven Outpost is very active, and a great place to get quick responses to questions for all Haven games. Spoilers are well-moderated in general channels, and there are special opt-in open spoiler channels for locked classes or for the whole campaign.

##  <a name="page_1" class="page-number">1.0</a> First Printing Production Errors and Typos

**Note - Room Tiles 8 and 14 are intentionally missing. This is not a production error.** See <a href="#page_2">Component and Setup Questions</a> for more details. 

![divider](/assets/images/divider.png)

## <a name="page_2" class="page-number">2.0</a> Component and First Time Setup Questions

**General -** As a legacy game, the general rule is that if you don’t see something referenced in the rules, it probably relates to unlockable content. Check this FAQ if you are unsure.

**I cannot find Room tiles 8 or 14. Am I missing a board?** No - room tile sizes and shapes were standardized in Frosthaven. Gloomhaven 2e uses the same numbers for the same shapes. There are no 8 or 14 room tiles in Gloomhaven Second Edition, and these tiles aren't needed for any scenaarios.

**How many of each Event deck do I use?** XXX

**What are all these stickers with rules for?** XXX

## <a name="page_3" class="page-number">3.0</a> General Gameplay Questions (Non-Scenario)

### <a name="page_31" class="page-number">3.1</a> Masteries

**Can I complete my Mastery in Scenario 0?** No. Scenario 0 is intentionally easy.

**Do I need to complete a Mastery within a single scenario?** Sometimes; the Mastery itself will let you know if it needs to be completed in a single scenario. By default, most Masteries can be done over multiple scenarios. *This is a change from Frosthaven*

**If I need to do something every round, do I still get my Mastery if I exhaust before the end of the scenario?** Yes. Any mastery which requires you to do something "every round" should be read as "every round in which you perform a turn."

**Am I allowed to exhaust for a mastery that requires me to keep a summon alive until the end of a scenario?** No. If you exhaust, your summons are removed from the board before the end of the scenario. 

![divider-narrow](/assets/images/divider2.png)

### <a name="page_32" class="page-number">3.2</a> Personal Quests

**My Personal Quest gives me a scenario and says to 'follow it to its conclusion.' What does that mean? Do I retire after the scenario?** You keep going until the game explicitly tells you that your quest is complete in a Scenario Rewards box.

**If, during a City Phase, I no longer qualify for retirement (for example, if I had a quest to collect gold but spent below the threshold), do I still retire?** No. If you no longer meet the requirements for your PQ, you no longer retire.

**If I abandon a character in the middle of a PQ that unlocks scenarios, what happens to the scenarios?** They all become Incomplete and are re-locked. Any opened chests and looted random items from the loot deck remain looted. 

![divider-narrow](/assets/images/divider2.png)

### <a name="page_33" class="page-number">3.3</a> Events and Traits
**Is my Ancestry another trait?** Effectively, yes, your Ancestry (quatryl, human, etc.) can operate as an additional Trait for your character. It operates like all other Traits on your character board. 

**If our City Event gives us a negative (or positive) condition in our next scenario, would a new character who came in during that City Phase's Downtime be subject to it?** No. If a character was not present for a City Event, they don't suffer its negative or benefit from its positive effects.

**If we fail a scenario but immediately re-try it, do we suffer the effects of our previous Road or City Events?** No; if you re-try, you disregard previous event outcomes.

**If an event has us losing XP, can we go below a level threshold?** No. You cannot lose XP beyond the minimum for your current level.

![divider](/assets/images/divider.png)

## <a name="page_4" class="page-number">4.0</a> City General Questions
**How does the Prosperity track work? What are the grey boxes? Do I need to check the big boxes with numbers?** The grey boxes are just there for help counting; they appear every 5 boxes. You need to mark off the big box with a number inside to actually increase to that Prosperity.

![divider-narrow](/assets/images/divider2.png)

### <a name="page_42" class="page-number">4.2</a> Enhancements

**Is there a limit on the number of enhancements a character can have?** No, there's no limit. This is a change from Gloomhaven 1st Edition.

**If I am enhancing an ability that can only affect multiple targets when an element is consumed or some other condition is met, does it cost double to enhance?** Yes. If an ability has conditional multi-targets, it still costs double. *This is a change from Gloomhaven 1st Edition.*

**My Summon has an inherent multi-target attack. Will enhancing its Range or Attack cost double the normal cost for a summon?** Yes.

![divider](/assets/images/divider.png)

## <a name="page_5" class="page-number">5.0</a> General Gameplay Questions (Scenario)

### <a name="page_51" class="page-number">5.1</a> Rooms, Movement, Forced Movement, and Overlays

**What is considered an ‘empty’ hex vs ‘featureless’, etc.?** A ‘featureless’ hex has no overlay tiles (other than corridors or pressure plates), but may have a figure. An ‘empty’ hex has neither overlay tiles nor figures. Note that tokens (loot tokens, deathwalker shadows, etc.) won’t make a hex non-empty. It is possible to summon or spawn on hexes with loot tokens. *This is a change from Gloomhaven.*

**Can I teleport over gaps between room tiles? If so, how do I measure the distance? There's no hexes to count.** Yes, as long as the destination tile is revealed, and the map tiles aren't free-floating (see below). The gap area between rooms is considered part of the wall. You can use extra corridor overlays to measure the distance, if it's not apparent. 

**Can I teleport to a revealed room tile that is totally disconnected from other room tiles?** Completely disconnected room tiles are an unmeasurable distance apart. Only teleports that ignore distance would work in these cases. (For an example of a scenario with this kind of layout, see Scenario <span class="hidden">24</span>.) 

**If my move ability has Jump, can I decide not to Jump?** Yes, but it must be decided at the start of your move ability. You can't decide to start Jumping after you begin moving, or decide to stop Jumping before the formal end of the move ability. If another effect adds Jump for your move ability mid-move, you remain Jumping until the formal end of your move ability.

**Can I Push and Pull with the same attack?** Yes, but note that all Pushes are combined together and all Pulls are combined together into the final Push and/or Pull. You must fully complete one before you perform the other. Yes, this can make an enemy take damage from the same hazardous terrain hex twice.

**Do I need Line of Sight to every hex I push an enemy into?** No. While your Push target needs to be within line of sight to start the Push, it can push the target out of line of sight, and even around doors.

**Can I forced move an enemy into hazardous terrain occupied by their ally, if it's the last hex of that movement, and if the moved enemy would be killed by it?** Yes, this is valid as long as only one figure would be left in that hex afterwards.

**Can I Push or Pull allies?** Because Forced Movement is a ‘negative ability’ you can only do so if the specific ability specifies you can.

**Is it possible to Push or Pull 0? Is that still considered forced movement?** No. You must move the target at least 1 hex for it to be considered a forced move, or a Push/Pull ability. If a main-line forced move ability has added effects on it, you must move the target at least 1 hex for those to take effect.

**Does moving back and forth between two hexes count as moving?** Yes. While there is no such thing as a Move 0, you can still end up in your origin hex if you have sufficient movement.

![divider-narrow](/assets/images/divider2.png)

### <a name="page_52" class="page-number">5.2</a> Damage, Shield, and Ward

**When I lose a card to avoid all damage, do I lose Ward?** Yes. Ward's and Brittle's effects are considered before the Damage Negation step.

**If I lose a card to avoid all damage, do I still need to mark use slots on defensive items like armor?** Yes, unless you can bring the damage to 0 by other means. The order of operations for taking damage means that mandatory items get used before you negate it by losing a card. 

**How does Shield interact with Ward?** Shield reduces damage before Ward is applied. If I have Shield 2 and Ward and take 6 damage, the damage is first reduced to 4 by Shield, then cut in half to 2 by Ward.

**I have an ability that references the damage a monster or I have "suffered." Is this the total damage I dealt?** No. While there's no cap to damage dealt, "damage suffered" is the result of that damage, after all ward, brittle, or negation - and is capped by the figure's remaining HP. This goes for all figures with HP. Damage suffered is basically the equivalent of moving an hp dial.

**I have an ability which refers to the damage a figure "would suffer." Is this likewise capped by the figure's HP?** No. "would suffer" isn't capped - it's after shield, ward, brittle, etc., but before any damage is actually suffered.

![divider-narrow](/assets/images/divider2.png)

### <a name="page_53" class="page-number">5.3</a> Attack Modifier Draws, Advantage, and Disadvantage

**What is the order of operations if I draw a x2 or Null on a draw with rolling modifiers?** If a Null (x0) is included in the final attack modifier draws, no matter where, the final damage will always be 0. If you draw a x2, it can be inserted at any time during attack modification including at the very end. (For example, if I have an Attack 3, draw a rolling +1, and finally a x2, I can decide if my final damage is 7 (3x2) + 1 or 8 (3+1) x2.)

**Which deck do my summons draw from?** All summons draw from their summoner's deck.

**If I draw multiple Heal Ally (or Heal Self) modifier draws, do they combine into one heal, or is each one separate?** They all combine into one heal ability, but you can either combine them to heal one target, or split them up to heal two or more. All heals to one target are combined into a single heal, and are not treated as multiple Heal 1’s.

**If I draw an attack modifier for a summon's attack that refers to something that doesn't make sense for it, for example gaining one of my tokens or a reference to one of my summons, how is this resolved?** All class-specific mechanics are controlled by the summoner, even when drawn by a summon. You gain the benefits of these attack modifier cards.

**I Controlled an enemy to attack, but they drew a positive condition that would apply to them - like a Heal or Invisible Self. Who benefits from this? Can I decide not to allow it?** Anything like "Invisible Self" will apply to the enemy who drew the modifier card. You can decide whether or not any added effect is applied from their modifier draw, however.

**Can you go into more detail on what draws for Advantage or Disadvantage are considered "ambiguous"? What's considered better or worse when drawn by a monster?** When you're comparing two modifier cards for Advantage or Disadvantage, all non-numeric effects listed on the modifier card (negative conditions, shield, elements, healing, etc.) have a *positive but unknown* value. Conditional numeric bonuses based on the board state (like Banner Spear's "Add +1 for each ally adjacent to the target" modifier cards) are evaluated and considered as part of the numeric value, where appropriate. The attack value is considered in cases where a x2 modifier is drawn. Items, such as the Iron Helm, that change the modifier card value, are also evaluated before a better/worse card is determined.

No other considerations for board state are included (such as an element already being strong, an enemy already being poisoned, a lack of extra targets, etc.) Rolling modifiers before the two terminal cards are also not considered; they are all included with either terminal card with Advantage, while all are discarded with Disadvantage.

Examples:
- 2x and Attack 2 vs +2: Ambiguous (2 x 2 = 2 + 2)
- 2x and Attack 2 vs +1: 2x is better (2 x 2 > 2 + 1)
- 2x and Attack 2 vs +2 when the target has a Crude Helm: +2 is better (the x2 effect is changed into a +1, and 2 + 1 < 2 + 2)
- +1 Stun vs +1: +1 Stun is better (Stun has a positive but unknown value, so is always better than just +1)
- +0 Stun vs +2: Ambiguous (Stun has a positive but unknown value, so it's impossible to determine if its value is better than a +2.)
- +1 Stun vs +1 Fire: Ambiguous (The two added effects can't be compared to one another, and because both modifiers have different added effects, the numeric value doesn't matter.)
- +1 Stun vs +2 Fire: Ambiguous (The two added effects can't be compared to one another, and because both modifiers have different added effects, the numeric value doesn't matter.)
- +0 Muddle vs +2 Stun: Ambiguous (While a player would almost certainly prefer a +2 stun, the unknown values of Muddle and Stun make them incomparable, and thus ambiguous.)

**If I have Disadvantage, and draw (for example) a +1 Stun and a +0 Stun, is this ambiguous?** No. While Stun, just like every other non-numeric modifier effect, has an "unknown but positive value," it is always exactly as valuable as itself. While two *different* non-numeric effects can't be compared, two *identical* ones can. In this case, the +1 Stun is better.

**Can I choose not to infuse an element I draw on a modifier card, or is it mandatory, like on my ability cards?** Unless the element is in a mandatory (!) box, elemental infusions on your modifier cards are optional.

![divider-narrow](/assets/images/divider2.png)

### <a name="page_54" class="page-number">5.4</a> Negative Conditions

**Does removing a summon with a negative condition count as removing a negative condition from it?** No.

**Can I target a figure with a condition they're immune to?** Yes. It still won't put the condition on the figure, but this may be important for some effects. *This is a change from Gloomhaven 1e* 

**Can you explain how Curse is a negative condition? Are Curse cards in my modifier deck also negative conditions?** When you are targeted by a Curse ability, you only momentarily have the Curse condition. This is long enough for you to block it with an item or Safeguard, or for it to be blocked by a monster's Curse immunity. It's otherwise removed instantly when a Curse card is added to your remaining attack modifier deck. Once the Curse card is in an attack modifier deck, the Curse is no longer considered a negative condition.

![divider-narrow](/assets/images/divider2.png)

### <a name="page_55" class="page-number">5.5</a> General Player Ability Questions and Clarifications

**If I have an Ability with a “Target All” can I choose to exclude some targets?** If there isn’t a Mandatory box, and it's not a negative effect on you or your allies, you can choose to exclude targets from a Target All effect.

**Can I skip targets in a red hex AoE attack?** Yes; a red hex AoE just determines the hexes where your potential targets are. *Note - this is a change from the Gloomhaven 1e FAQ, and is to make it consistent with all other non-mandatory targeting.*

**Can I skip the heal ability from long resting?** Yes.

**If I am making a Red Hex AoE attack, and an enemy spawns in the middle of my attack ability within the red hexes, can I attack them?** No, the enemy needs to have been present at the start of the red hex attack ability. 

**If I have a way to reduce ranges, can I reduce them to 0?** No. Range 1 is the minimum.

**If an attack's range is reduced down to 1, does it become a melee attack?** No. It remains a ranged attack with Range 1 (so it will usually have disadvantage on the attack). 

**Is Loot a "ranged ability"?** No.

**I have an ability that says "all enemies and allies take damage" but it's not in a Mandatory bubble. Can I decide not to affect my allies?** If an ability is not mandatory, it can be skipped entirely - but if you perform it, it affects all allies and all enemies.

**I have an attack modifier that references the position of an enemy. Does the enemy need to survive for this to function?** If the modifier is part of the attack ability (that is, a modifier draw or a rider on an attack without an ability separator line), it functions even if the enemy is killed by the attack.

**What does "adjacent" mean when we're talking about placing or triggering an overlay in an occupied hex?** The general rule is that a figure's own hex is considered adjacent to them for their own targeting purposes - however, their targets' own hexes are not adjacent to them. So if you were placing an overlay in a hex adjacent to yourself, you could target your own hex as long as it meets all the criteria for the ability. However, if you were placing it adjacent to another figure, it would have to be in one of the six hexes around them and not directly underneath them. (Note that Deathwalker's shadows break this general rule.)

**What's the difference between "Allies gain..." and "Grant allies..." when it comes to shield, retaliate, etc.?** A persistent or round bonus which says "Allies gain..." or "Allies have..." is performed by you, and only applies to allies who presently fit the condition when they would use it; usually this has a range limitation. On the other hand, a Grant lets the ally perform the ability - and once granted, it's theirs for the duration. In short -
- An effect which says "Adjacent allies gain Shield 1," applies to allies who are adjacent to you, but is not kept when they move away. By the same token, an ally moving into range of the effect can gain it even if they weren't there when the ability was played. Colloquially, these are sometimes called "auras" by the community. [Banner Spear 3 Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/any2cards/worldhaven/master/images/character-ability-cards/frosthaven/BN/fh-let-them-come.png)
- An effect which says "Grant all adjacent allies Shield 1" means they can immediately perform a Shield 1 (Self) ability (if able), and it lasts until the card is lost or discarded, even if they move away from you this round. [Banner Spear 5 Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/any2cards/worldhaven/master/images/character-ability-cards/frosthaven/BN/fh-hold-the-line.png)

**Can my Initiative be below 01 or above 99 after applying items or ability effects?** Yes; initiative can be any number, in theory.

**Is my Long Rest at Initiative 99, or is it always last in order?** Your Long Rest takes place at Initiative 99. It is not necessarily last in order; if a game effect pushes a figure's initiative above 99, it will act after your long rest. Your long rest will be performed before monster turns on Initiative 99, and is ambiguously timed with other players acting at 99. *This is a change from the Gloomhaven 1e FAQ*

**What does "end of turn" mean? If I have a persistent ability that lets me do things at the "end of my turn," how is that timed relative to elemental infusion, or losing a Stun?** While all of these say "end of turn," they're not all timed equally. There is an "end of player turn" phase of sorts, where players can still perform appropriate abilities (example: Geminate's "Harvest the Essence"). Then, once all abilities are complete, there's an "end of turn wrap-up," during which (1) infused elements are moved to Strong, (2) "end of turn" conditions expire, and (3) a character performs end of turn looting. These three wrap-up steps are ambiguously timed with one another, and can only start once a player formally concludes their turn. Some other effects, like a Geminate's form change, can also take place during this step, but no Abilities can be performed.

**Granted Attacks - Is there a difference between a Commanded or Granted Attack +X and Attack X?** Yes; see below.
- Both Attack +X and Attack X will inherit all special attack modifiers for a monster or character summon. This includes extra targets, added conditions, attack patterns, etc.
- Attack X is always a melee attack at the value provided. It can be granted to a non-objective figure that does not have an inherent Attack value.
- Attack +X depends on the monster's or summon's inherent attack value. For monsters, this attack is always melee. For a Summon, however, *it will inherit any Range characteristic the Summon always has (if any)*.

**I have a Grant ability with an elemental consumption, for example [Boneshaper's Level 1 Dark Tidings](https://github.com/any2cards/frosthaven/blob/master/images/character-ability-cards/frosthaven/BO/fh-dark-tidings.png?raw=true). Who consumes this element? The Boneshaper or the target of the Grant?** The granting figure performs any elemental consumptions, and gains earned XP from it (if any). If one Grant ability grants abilities to more than one target, all of them will benefit from one elemental consumption. The target of the Grant still performs any granted abilities like normal, including new abilities enabled by the elemental consumption.

![divider-narrow](/assets/images/divider2.png)

### <a name="page_56" class="page-number">5.6</a> Coin and Loot Questions

**What happens if I run out coin tokens?** There are no more coins in the scenario. Coins in Gloomhaven 2e are intentionally component-limited.

**If a chest reward item has -1's, would I have to add them for the rest of the scenario?** You can choose not to equip it. If you do equip it and don't have a perk to ignore negative item effects, you'll have to add the -1's.

**Do my summons drop coins when they are killed?** No. Only enemy monsters can drop coins. 

![divider-narrow](/assets/images/divider2.png)

### <a name="page_57" class="page-number">5.7</a> Objectives

**Does destroying an objective count as a "kill" for abilities or battle goals?** No. Objectives are destroyed, not killed. 

**Can an allied Objective be healed?** Yes.

**Can I move through an allied Objective?** Not without Jump or Fly.

**If an Objective occupies more than one hex, can I attack it more than once with a red hex AoE pattern that targets more than one of its hexes?** No. No matter how many hexes an Objective occupies, it's still just one figure.

**If an Objective occupies more than one hex, can I target the hex furthest from me? Say, if I'm adjacent to one hex, can I target my ranged attack at a non-adjacent one to avoid disadvantage? Or to avoid melee Retaliate?** Yes and No. Even though the Objective occupies more than one hex, it's still just one figure, so if you are adjacent to it you'll still have Disadvantage and/or suffer Retaliate. But, with that said, all hexes of the Objective are targetable, for red hex patterns or other purposes. 

![divider-narrow](/assets/images/divider2.png)

### <a name="page_58" class="page-number">5.8</a> Monster Focus, Abilities, and Stats

**If a monster with a ranged attack is adjacent to one enemy, but could attack another enemy without disadvantage, which enemy will it attack?** Monster focus doesn't consider disadvantage. It will always prioritize the adjacent enemy in this case. If the monster would lose disadvantage by moving away from its focus, if it can do so with its current movement, and if it can do so without entering a negative hex, it will. It will move as little as it can, in order to lose disadvantage.

**Will a monster enter a negative hex (a trap or hazardous terrain) if it's the only way to attack an enemy this turn?** Usually not. A monster's first focus priority is to choose a hex from which they can attack an enemy, using the least possible movement, *preferring "safe" paths of any length over any paths with negative hexes*. They will choose a safer path even if it's much longer, and even if it means they can't attack their focus this turn. They will only choose a path with one or more negative hexes if it's the only way to attack *any* enemy, ever, looking at the current state of the board, pretending the monster has infinite movement. Remember - path length is part of selecting a monster's focus, not something done after focus has been selected. Monsters will focus on an enemy that's apparently further away, by range, if it means they can avoid entering negative hexes. See the steps on p74 of the rulebook for examples.

**If an enemy must move through a choice of traps, will it consider the strength of those traps when determining which one to move through?**  No, monsters will take into account the *number* of negative hexes, but not the *strength or effects* of them. When it's otherwise ambiguous, you can resolve ambiguity in your favor. Note that they will always prefer a path with zero negative hexes, regardless of length, just like normal.

**Will enemies also avoid difficult terrain?** Not necessarily. Difficult terrain is not considered a negative hex, but its effect is considered for monster focus decisions.

**If a monster is trying to make a multi-target attack this turn, but does not have enough movement to attack any targets, will it move towards its primary focus or towards a position to potentially maximize the attack?** It will move towards its primary focus.

**How does a monster with a multi-target attack choose its destination hex and its additional targets? Do you use focus rules to determine targets other than the primary focus?** As long as a monster is (a) still attacking their primary focus, (b) avoiding additional negative hexes, (c) attacking as many additional targets as possible, (d) minimizing the amount of disadvantage, and (e) minimizing move distance (in that order), players can choose the final destination hex and secondary, tertiary, etc. targets. Unlike Gloomhaven, monsters do not use a focus process for finding additional targets, and players have a lot of latitude in choosing their additional targets. *This is a change from Gloomhaven 1st Edition*

**When a monster is attacking more than one target, what order are those attacks made in?** The actual order of attacks is ambiguous. Players can determine the attack order once all targets are determined. The primary focus does not need to be attacked first. If a target has a Retaliate value, it's possible to kill a monster before all its attacks are made. This applies to both Target X and red hex AoE attack abilities.

**How does a monster move if it has a move but no attacks on its action card this turn?** It finds focus and moves as if it were making a melee attack, even if this takes it out of range for its non-attack abilities. 

**How do monster Pushes and Pulls work? Can I choose a path which prevents them from pushing or pulling me less than the maximum amount?** A path must be chosen that pushes or pulls you the maximum amount possible, considering the whole path. You cannot, for example, choose a hex that would stop a push by a wall or obstacle if there’s another valid path which avoids it. If there is nearby Icy Terrain, monsters will consider its effect while trying to maximize their forced movement abilities. *This is a change from Gloomhaven 1st Edition.* 

**How do monster Infusions and Consumptions work?** Frosthaven works differently from Gloomhaven 1st Edition, here. If there's an Infusion or Consumption on their ability card, those elements will be Infused or Consumed if **any** monster in the set performs **any** ability on it, even if that ability isn't modified by the elemental consumption. Note that some abilities - like "suffer damage" - are not targeted, and will be performed even if no enemies are in range.
- Example 1 - Earth Demons' Nothing Special says "Move +0 Attack +0, Infuse Earth." If they can neither move nor attack this round, Earth will not be infused.
- Example 2 - The Earth Demons' Ground Slam says, "Move -1, Attack -1 target all adjacent; consume earth to add Push 1". Even if no Earth Demons can attack, they will still consume the Earth as long as at least 1 of them moves, because they are still performing an ability on the card.

**Does this apply to "standalone" abilities tied to elemental consumption? For example, if a Night Demon can consume dark to perform Invisible Self, does it need to also move or attack?** If an elemental consumption would enable a standalone ability, the monster set will consume it to perform the ability even if it is performing no other abilities on its card. In this specific case, all Night Demons would consume dark to turn Invisible even if none also move or attack. 

**When does a Monster consume an element? When does a Monster infuse an element?** If any monster in a set is going to perform any ability this round, elements are consumed at the start of the first monster in the set's turn, and elements are infused after the last monster in the set's turn. All monsters in the set benefit from any elemental consumption.

### <a name="page_59" class="page-number">5.9</a> Scenario Allies

**I have a Scenario Ally (or enemy) who "can't be interacted with." What does this mean?** A figure who "can't be interacted with" occupies their space. They can be moved through by allies, but not by enemies. They cannot be targeted by any attacks or abilities, cannot be damaged, and will never draw focus. They are affected normally by obstacles, icy, and difficult terrain - but do not treat traps or hazardous terrain as negative hexes. They do not spring traps and cannot be affected by them. They cannot be used for Banner Spear formations or anything that counts allies or ally positioning except things explicitly called out in the scenario rules.

## <a name="page_7" class="page-number">7.0</a> General Scenario Questions

**Do I need to return to Gloomhaven after every successful scenario?** Yes, unless the scenario you just completed is Linked or Force-Linked to another scenario. This is indicated by a chain link icon with a red or yellow exclamation point in the Scenario Rewards when a new scenario is first unlocked. You cannot replay a scenario you've successfully completed without returning to Gloomhaven, and links are only one-way.

**I don’t understand the difference between Campaign and Casual mode. What does all this mean?** 
Generally, scenarios are played in Campaign Mode. Casual Mode is primarily for re-playing already played scenarios, but with zero game impacts.
- Casual Mode: You get no coins, XP, quest progression, etc. You don’t draw any events, and there's no City Phase afterwards. It is really just playing the game to enjoy it, with zero campaign impact.
- Campaign Mode: If you replay a scenario in Campaign Mode, you can earn coins, XP, quest progress, and any unlooted treasure chests. You won’t get the Scenario Rewards if you’ve already won the scenario. You may need to resolve a road event if you’re replaying a scenario outside of Gloomhaven. After the scenario, you will have a City Phase, where time will pass.

**Can I replay a scenario to loot an unlooted treasure chest?** Yes, but it must be replayed in Campaign Mode. You would run the scenario just like you ran it the first time, except you do not receive any Scenario Rewards for completion. (Just the coins, chests, xp, etc.)

**What about a random scenario from the random dungeon deck? How do those fit in?** Random scenarios can be played in either Casual Mode or Campaign Mode; it is up to you. See above for the differences. Random scenarios do not require a Road Event.

**If I lose a scenario but we choose to replay it, do I keep anything?** You keep all gold (including that gained from loot cards), anything gained from treasure chests, and XP earned from your action cards.

**Why are some scenario markers in grey and some in green?** All are considered to share the same marker, but there's only enough physical markers for the green ones. 

**How much scenario information are we allowed to look at while trying to decide which one to go to next? Can I look at the loot tables, the monsters, etc. before picking in order to get PQ progress?** You can look at anything on the main page(s) of the scenario - including the loot deck, layout, complexity, monster list, presence of treasure tiles, etc. - but not any section links. 

**If there is a calculation, but no indication of the direction of rounding, what direction do you round?** Usually a calculation will tell you the intended direction of rounding. If it does not, assume it rounds up.

**This scenario has a boss with a number of health thresholds. What happens if we reduce a boss below two of these at once - or even all the way to 0 health?** The first pending section must be resolved before anything else can happen, and the boss isn't considered dead yet. Generally, these sections will reset the boss's health to a certain amount; the intent is that they can't be killed by a single strong attack. The section (or first section if there's more than one) needs to be resolved before anything else.

**Do I need to kill enemies that have not yet spawned in order to beat a scenario with a goal of "When all enemies in it are dead"?** Yes. Enemies on set spawns for specific rounds are still considered "in the scenario" and must be defeated in order to fulfill that win condition.

### <a name="page_72" class="page-number">7.2</a> Solo Scenario Questions

**Can I gain Masteries or Battle Goals during a Solo Scenario? Can I progress my PQ? Do I gain Inspiration?** You can pursue Masteries and Battle Goals. You can also progress your Personal Quest towards retirement. You do not gain Inspiration - Inspiration is based on party size, and both the minimum and maximum party size for a solo scenario is 1.

**Do I need to kill enemies that have not yet spawned in order to beat this solo scenario?** Many solo scenarios have a win condition of "when all enemies in it are dead" along with set spawns for specific rounds. Spawns that haven't appeared yet are still considered part of the scenario, and must be defeated.

**Can I level up, purchase items, or purchase enhancements after my solo scenario is complete?** These activities need to wait until the next campaign Downtime phase, whenever that happens over the normal course of play. Solo scenarios take place outside of the normal Scenario/City flow, and those activities are limited to Downtime.

**Defensive Tactics (5, top) - Does this replace my original Shield or Retaliate ability?** No, Defensive Tactics adds to the first Shield or Retaliate you gain each round. If you use Shield Bash (1, bot) while Defensive Tactics is active, you will gain a total of Shield 2, Retaliate 1.

**Defensive Tactics (5, top) - Does this also apply when I gain Retaliate from a modifier card, or from a persistent effect like Warding Strength (1, bot)?** Yes, it adds to the first Shield or Retaliate you gain each round from your ability or attack modifier cards. A persistent effect is still on one of your cards.

**If I Control a monster to attack using my deck, and they draw an "Invisible, Self" modifier, who benefits?** "Self" refers to the acting figure - so the monster would turn invisible. You, however, are in control of your modifier deck, and make all decisions that need to be made regarding it. You can choose not to apply it. 

**Does my 'Lying Low' (last in initiative) perk also help my Summons?** No; this perk only applies to you, and does not actually change when you are acting in the round.

<p><b>I have questions about the two check perk, Xorn's Propogation...</b> (1) Yes, you can control the monster even if it has already acted in the round. This happens out of turn. (2) If the ability has bonuses for elemental consumption, it can consume elements to improve it, and won't benefit from any previous elemental consumptions. (2a) It will repeat any elemental infusions, as well. (3) The monster would still have any conditions it had; this happens before it actually dies. (4) If the monster enters any traps or hazards while being controlled, it will remove any traps, and suffer any conditions from them, but can't take further damage.</p>

## <a name="page_9" class="page-number">9.0</a> Items (General)

**What happens if I gain an item I can't gain? Say, because all copies of it are owned by other party members?** When a character gains an item they cannot gain (for any reason), they must sell it immediately/

**I have an item (such as an Iron Helm) that modifies the monster's attack modifier draw. How does that work if the monster has Advantage or Disadvantage?** The effects of the item should be applied *before* the modifier is chosen. *This is a change from a Gloomhaven 1e FAQ ruling.*

**Will my Spent item with use slots recover its uses if I Long Rest before all of the charges are expended?** Yes, Spent items recover all their use slots whenever they are recovered, whether as part of a long rest or an item recovery ability. A Lost item will not recover its charges on a long rest; it would only recover its charges when you use an ability that can recover Lost items. *This is a change from Gloomhaven 1e.*

**Can I use an item in the middle of my move or attack ability?** Only if it is not itself an ability, and it says something like "during your move ability." If an item allows you to perform another ability (like healing, damaging, destroying an obstacle, etc.), you need to finish your ability first. See below for a more detailed answer. *This is a change from a Gloomhaven 1e FAQ ruling.*

**When is item usage an ability?** The following are Abilities as defined in the Gloomhaven rulebook - Move, Teleport, Attack, Conditions (positive or negative), Heal, Forced Movement, Loot, Suffer Damage (self, allies, or enemies), Recover (cards or items), Commanding Figures, Manipulating Tiles, and Active Bonuses. Active Bonuses take some interpretation for items because there's not always a Round or Persistent icon, but this was largely for graphic design reasons - making it less clear, which is why this is complicated. If an Item gives a turn-long, round-long, or persistent bonus such as "add Jump to all your move abilities", it is itself an ability. If it says something more along the lines of "during your attack" or "during your move" or "on the next attacks targeting you" it's not an active bonus with any kind of duration, and therefore not an ability. This distinction is important because you generally can't interrupt your ability with another ability.

Basically, if an item only makes sense if used within another ability or in reaction to one, that's how it's supposed to work and it's not an ability. If it makes sense used independently, it probably is an ability.

**Can I use an item during my Start of Turn phase? For example, can I use a Circlet of Life to heal a Wound before I take damage from it?** Generally, no; items with a timing of "during your turn" cannot be used in the Start of Turn phase.
